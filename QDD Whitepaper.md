Our responsibility, as the dev team, is to ensure that your trip with $QDD soars as smoothly as possible.

Your responsibility as a Holder is to do just that: Hold! All we ask of you is to be transparent with us, vote on what you like about the token, spread the word to your friends and family, and HODL! Safety, Transparency, and Evolution are our three driving principles that you can rely on.

Earth.
